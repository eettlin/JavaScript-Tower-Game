# JavaScript-Tower-Game
Post APCS-A project in JavaScript

This project was completed by my game coding kids at Woodside HS in Woodside CA in the Spring of 2017

This code also accompanies a tutorial series on YouTube:  https://youtu.be/XzDTvFNZ0Kc

In this version, we added sliders to control ariable values to make the game more playable.
